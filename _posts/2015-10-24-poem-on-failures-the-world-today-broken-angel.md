## Everyone is expected to do something great but at every corner he/she is criticized, pulled down, taunted every time when a failures comes the way. Here a poem on failures to show how the world treats a failed person.

Every person is angel for the other but will they be with you when you are a Broken Angel. Just a poem on failures, a dark reality, the world today.

#### BROKEN ANGEL

**_Out in the edge falling apart_**  
**_Blinded shattered and broken  
Stranded in the cold desolate path  
Thrown into the belly of the dark demon_**  
**_No one to catch,no one to fight it out  
Unprotected left threatened in the open  
_** **_No one to hear_**  
**_Eventually shouts loud_**  
**_Felt only by the presence of raven_**  
**_Once bestowed with euphoria and proud  
Blessed homed in the Eden_**  
**_Wings out that covered the crowd  
But in this fiendish world wings left broken  
The blessing hands have disowned  
Battered to the ground the hearts frozen  
The world left it to be own its own_**  
**_All alone_**  
**_Out from the edge falls the broken angel!_**

I had written this poem on failures when I was all alone and there was no one to look forward to. Most of the people kept on reminding me of my failures where I actually needed morale support. Just realized every person is all alone when you don’t have success on your way. But the most important thing is fighting your way out and continuing fighting even though there will be people happy to see you down there. Have faith and believe that good times will come. Hope you could connect with this poem on failures the broken angel.
