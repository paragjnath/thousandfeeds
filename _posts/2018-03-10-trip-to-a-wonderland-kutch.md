Hi There,  
<!--more-->

If you have already read my last posts, until now I was visiting old monuments, ancient villages and hills. This time I experienced the graceful bliss of silence under the moonlight beauty, standing on the edge of  the Nation. This is the white desert of India, known as Kutch.<!--more-->

I was always fascinated by the skylight, illuminating fields and spreading it&#8217;s edge beyond end. The moonlight and the silver salty desert fulfilled my dream. When I was about to reach, I was stunned looking at the evening sky, as it was the daylight wishing all good-bye and eventually the night sky is waking up from a beautiful dream.<!--more-->

**0. Best Seasons to Visit: **<!--more-->

People visiting Kutch in summer would find uncomfortable weather however, the winter is pleasant. I would advice you to visit by November to February and you will be able to attend the great Kutch festival, Rann Utsav.

**1. How to reach Kutch:  **  
<!--more-->

<span data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;"><br /> </span><span data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">There is alot of ways to reach Kutch however you need to reach Bhuj first. I&#8217;ll try to jot down some of the efficient ways to reach,</span>

<ul data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Reach Ahmedabad and take a cab to Gita Nagar bus stop. From there government bus will take you to Bhuj. The distance is almost 330 KM.  This might take 5/6 hours and the cost is 250 Rs.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may take <a href="http://www.airindia.in/" data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-blogger-escaped-style="color: red;">flight</span></a> direct to Bhuj from anywhere from the country however it will charge you a bomb.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you fancy about travelling in a <a href="http://www.irctc.co.in/" data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-blogger-escaped-style="color: red;">train</span></a>, you may come directly to Bhuj, the station code is BHUJ. However, direct train service are available from selected cities only. e.g. Delhi.
  </li>
</ul>

    <!--more-->The Rann of Kutch is 100 K.M. away from Bhuj. I rented a private car and that&#8217;s why the cost was little high. However, let me tell you get a bike if possible. Mark my words, you will remember the ride the whole of your life.
