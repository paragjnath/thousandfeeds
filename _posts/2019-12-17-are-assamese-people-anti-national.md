# Are Assamese people anti-National?

*Assam is protesting against immigration(Citizenship Amendment  Act) when they themselves live across different states of India. Is it hypocrisy or have we failed to understand their emotion?*



Ever since the Union Cabinet passed the draft of Citizenship Amendment Bill  smoke of anger started brewing in Assam. Smoke turned into flare as the bill was tabled in parliament and in no time flare became fire with the passage of the bill in both the houses of the parliament.

People came onto the street protesting, with some holding playcards while a few preferred sticks. Today every Assamese have embraced the *'gamosa'* with pride, love and fear for its motherland. Chants of *'Joi Aai Asom'* (Hail Mother Assam) is reverberating along the valleys of the mighty Brahmaputra who is angry as well deeply hurt. The lush green tea gardens looks pale whereas the Oil fields have became muddy in rage and sorrow.

Assamese felt what Dr. Bhupen Hazarika wrote *'Sukatura Aai sukuloi saba kenekoi'* (how will one look into the dried down eyes of one's mother) in the song *"Akou Judi Jabo Lage Saraighat o loi"* for it had cried far too long.
 

However, why is that the rest of India or media cannot connect with Assamese emotion? They have valid question when they asks Why Assamese people are so selfish so as to not let others live in their land while they are happily spread across India or Why is Assam Accord so important or Why shouldn't we call Assam anti-National? Perhaps there are hundred more questions which fellow Indians are asking!

**Being an Assamese with no malice in the heart, we should be able to answer them in plain and simple words so as to not let politics and vocabulary confuse or veil their sense of understanding for it is our duty to make them understand when they have somewhat failed to connect with our emotions.**

The thing which most fellow Indians have not realized which has led to such questions is lack of understanding about migration and voting rights.

- Migration vs Immigration:-
Immigration is strictly used to describe the movement of people across countries(legal or illegal). Assamese migrates to other part of India as Indians whereas a foreigner (Bangladeshi here) immigrates to India(Assam here) illegalily. Assamese are not against fellow Indians irrespective of caste, creed, religion etc  migrating to  Assam
- Voting Rights and Political Rights in a state of India:-
When someone has a voting right in a state that person can shape or determine the policy affecting the social, cultural, economical as well as political aspects of that place directly. Generally, an Assamese will cast his vote in Assam during election and not at the place where he/she is temporarily working.


Illegal immigration of Bangladeshi in Assam is not in same scale (huge difference) as that of Pakistanis in North-Western part of India. Assam has suffered for many years due to illegal immigration and its plight got worse over the years because of the negligence of both Central and State Government. For further details one may look into Assam Accord 1985. The fear of losing one's culture and language is what is keeping Assam in edge.

Assamese people aversion towards CAA is also compounded by historical facts which is not known to fellow Indians. In 1826, when British colonised Assam they made it a part of Bengal Presidency and subsequently Bengali was imposed on Assamese people in between 1836-1873 which is also refered as the Dark Ages of Assamese Language.

Assamese is both a language and ethnic identity of people living in Assam. Today Assamese are sceptical of the idea of giving citizenship to huge number of Bangladeshi which will not only lead to cultural and language degradation but might also lead to division and violent clashes between Assamese and Bengali speaking people living in Assam.
