 When you came, my heart sparkled with joy,

 Lo! Autumn arrived, I was scared and lost my glow. 

 Winter was colder cause it gave me a new sparkle but not you, 

 Ah! My heart is weeping cold and is melting slow.

 It's all black and white to me;

 Winter is not only cold now, but darkness has gripped it too.

 Came spring and the ruins were almost gone.

 I smiled and looked at the sun as an infant's dream took its first breath.
