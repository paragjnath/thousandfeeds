Rowing under the floating clouds, 

navigating in the raging storm; 

Blue is what I was hoping all along 
 
but all i can see is gloom and dark.

Flash of lightening on the mast, 

crafting monsters way too large. 

Night is long and rain is heavy 

I too wish...to kiss the shore.

It seemed so calm as I woke up from sleep

Aghast! I was still there on the sea.
