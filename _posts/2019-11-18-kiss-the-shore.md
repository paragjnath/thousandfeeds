Rowing under the floating clouds,
navigating in the raging storm;
Blue is what I was hoping all along
but all i can see is gloom and dark.

Flash of lightening on the mast,
crafting monsters way too large.
Night is long and rain is heavy
I too wish...to kiss the shore.

It seemed so calm as I woke up from sleep
Aghast! I was still there on the sea.
