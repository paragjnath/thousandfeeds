**_God bless the friend who overlooks_**

**_All the faults in me_**  
**_Who loves me for myself_**  
**_And for the things that I can be_**  
**_Whose delicate heart and thoughtful ways_**  
**_Add so much meaning to my living days_**

**_God bless the friend_**  
**_Who is always there for me_**  
**_When I sink down and of the edge_**  
**_Makes me smile with a glaze_**  
**_Who cares for me day after day_**  
**_And understands me come what may_**

**_God bless the friend whose perky ways_**  
**_Can cause the sun to shine_**  
**_Who helps me see lifes goodness_**  
**_And the blessings that are mine_**  
**_That friendship is real part_**  
**_Of all thats precious in my heart._**
